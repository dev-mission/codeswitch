              Networking can be intimidating, we know. This is why our platform is designed to give you the opportunity
              to choose when you have to set up a call, and with whom. Whenever you think you found the right fit, set up 
              a preliminary call to make sure! If all goes well, attend our kickoff mixer event and start your three month
              mentorship.
